# DengueTimeSeriesAnalysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of dengue fever cases in San Juan and Iquitos, using time series data. The study includes:

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and visualizing data trends.

**Time Series Decomposition**: Breaking down dengue cases into trend, seasonal, and residual components.

**Time Series Clustering**: Identifying similar patterns in dengue case data.

**Cross-Correlation Analysis**: Examining the relationship between dengue cases and various climate variables.

**Comparative Analysis**: Comparing dengue trends between San Juan and Iquitos.

The goal of this project is to understand the temporal dynamics of dengue outbreaks and provide insights that can inform public health strategies.
